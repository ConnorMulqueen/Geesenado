## Project Description:
### MVP:


We will make a 2D-topdown game that will take place on a map that resembles UB’s north campus. There will be multiple playable characters to play as including (Jesse, Alphonce, Bina, Satish, Atri, Ziarek, and Victor e. Bull). Items will be randomly spawned on the map and available for pickup (pencils, rulers, paper, notebook, textbooks), these can be used to lower the GPA (health) of students. Depending on the item used, more damage will be inflicted to the GPA. ‘Extra credit’ will also randomly spawn on the map where you can increase your GPA just by collecting them. The boundary of the map is represented as a tornado of geese - this will shrink as the game goes on so that players and npcs must try to run closer to the center. If characters are caught in the geesenado, damage will be inflicted over time. NPCs will be semi-intelligent and will have the following features: able to attempt to dodge attacks, will run to the center of the map if the geesenado is closing, will start to panic if their GPA gets too low, and  will fight other NPCs. After each game the player is presented with a stats screen that ranks players based on their performance in the game.

## Add-On Features: 

-**Multiplayer Network Capabilities:** Make the game multiplayer, playable over a network. Players will be randomly spawned and can fully interact with each other (damage each others GPA).

-**Characters have different stats/attributes:** Make it so that each playable character has different stats (for example: Alphonce has a faster run speed than Bina)

-**Infection gamemode:** Make a multiplayer gamemode where one player starts as an infected student and that student must infect all other students within a certain time period, while the unaffected students must remain healthy.

-**Horde gamemode:** Make a gamemode where you spend the night in Davis Hall and fight off hordes of 115 students swarming your Office Hours. This game mode will have rounds and a scoring system.

-**Another Map:** Develop another map for the game to be played on as a menu option.

-**Global Leaderboard System:** Setup a database that keeps track of stats across all games. Players are able to enter in a 3 letter initial like an arcade game leaderboard.

-**Different difficulties:** Make the AI of the game have 3 difficulties (easy, medium, hard) and have the AI scale up and down depending on the difficulty chosen.

-**Boss System:** There will be one boss that randomly spawns on the map (possibly a mecha-goose) at a random time interval. When the boss is defeated it should give the player some kind of power up (possibly a academic integrity cannon).

-**Custom Characters:** Add functionality that allows an end-user to create their own custom characters.

-**Local co-op:** Add a local cooperative feature where 2 players can play on one device.

## User Story:
I want to play a singleplayer 2D battle royale type game that takes place on UB’s campus where I can play as a faculty member and use various items to lower students GPA. The objective of the game is to avoid the enclosing geese tornado (geesenado) and fail all the students.
